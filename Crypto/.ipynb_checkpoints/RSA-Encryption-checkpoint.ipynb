      "### Factoring\n",
      "\n",
      "Factoring is to find prime factors of a composite number, and we want this can be solved in poynomial time. However, even for a easy case, say just two primes, this problem is still very hard.  [See this wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization) You could say that we can increase computation power to make it faster since they are growing everyday, but the solution would be much easier that we just simply increase the size of the prime factors to make the problem relatively hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "### RSA Assumption\n",
      "\n",
      "RSA needs a modulo as \\\\(N=pq\\\\), while \\\\(p\\\\) and \\\\(q\\\\) are \\\\(n\\\\)-bit primes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before looking into RSA, we need to introduce Phi function or Euler's totient \\\\(\\phi(n)\\\\).\n",
      "This function gives the number of positve integers less or euqal to \\\\(n\\\\) that are [relatively prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers) to \\\\(n\\\\). I hope every reader knows what is co-prime. It may be hard to calculate how manay co-prime in a randomly given very large \\\\(n\\\\). However, if \\\\(n\\\\) is a prime, then we can say \\\\(\\phi(n) = n-1 \\\\) because all the other intergers less or euqal to \\\\(n\\\\) are \\\\(n\\\\)'s co-prime. Also this phi function is multiplicative that \\\\(\\phi(mn)=\\phi(m)\\phi(n)\\\\) as long as they are co-prime. Back to the case of RSA where \\\\(N=pq\\\\), then \\\\(\\phi(N) = \\phi(p)\\phi(q) = (p-1)(q-1)\\\\). \n",
      "\n",
      "In RSA, we need to find a integer \\\\(e\\\\) such that \\\\(\\gcd(e, \\phi(N)) = 1\\\\) and a integer \\\\(d\\\\) such that \\\\(ed = 1 \\mod \\phi(N) \\\\). Since \\\\(d\\\\) can be written like this \\\\(d = e^{-1} \\mod \\phi(N) \\\\), this is called multiplicative inverse of \\\\(e \\mod \\phi(N)\\\\). In RSA, \\\\(e\\\\) will be released as the public key and \\\\(d\\\\) will be released as the private key.  In the key generation phase, we can calculate \\\\(d\\\\) using [extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm). Originally, Euclidean algorithm is used to find greatest common divisor. extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension, by outputing the greated common divisor of \\\\(a,b\\\\) in a form as \\\\(ax+by\\\\). \n",
      "\n",
      "So how this extended Euclidean algorithm is related to the multiplicative inverse of modulo? For example, we have \\\\((e,N)\\\\) and we want to get \\\\(d\\\\), we can just run \\\\(\\text{exEuclidean}(e,\\phi(N)) = ae+y\\phi(N) = 1 \\\\). Do a modulo \\\\(\\phi(N)\\\\) at both side, we can get \\\\(ae \\equiv 1 \\mod \\phi(N)\\\\). We set \\\\(d = a\\\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "RSA is based on factoring because if the factoring problem is easy to solve then we can solve RSA problem easily. That is if we know that the two primes in \\\\(N\\\\), then we can calculate the \\\\(\\phi(N)\\\\) using equation above, then we can compute the inverse \\\\(d\\\\) of \\\\(e\\\\) modulo \\\\(\\phi(N)\\\\) using algorithm such as extended Euclidean. Since \\\\(d\\\\) is the private key, which mean the owner of \\\\(d\\\\) can just decipher the cipher text.\n",
